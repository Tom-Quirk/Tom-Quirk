- My most recent project involved building a Random Forest Classification Algorithm from scratch in Python with NumPy as part of my 2nd year AI module coursework.
- A 4-page pdf report on the entire ML pipeline building process can be found inside machine_learning_cw.pdf.
- The code for this project can be found inside TQ_ML_BCI_Coursework.ipynb
- To view my code, click on the .ipynb file in the repository, then "command" + "f" and type in "Implementation of Random Forest using NumPy arrays".
