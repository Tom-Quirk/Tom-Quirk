- 👋 Hi, I’m @Tom-Quirk .
- 👀 I’m a 2nd year studying Mathematics and Computer Science at Durham University.
- 📫 How to reach me: email: thomas.q@hotmail.co.uk  linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-quirk2002/ .

- My most recent project involved building a Random Forest Classification Algorithm from scratch in Python using NumPy arrays as part of my 2nd year AI module coursework.
- To view my code, click on the .ipynb file in the repository, then "command" + "f" and type in "Implementation of Random Forest using NumPy arrays".
- I learned this algorithm with the help of youtube videos and another 2nd year module: "Data Science for Statistical Computing" where I learned about the mathematics behind
  bootstrapping.
- A 4-page report on the entire ML pipeline building process will be uploaded shortly.
